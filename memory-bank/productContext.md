# World Ballets Product Context

## Purpose & Vision

World Ballets exists to solve a common problem for ballet enthusiasts: the difficulty of discovering and tracking performances across multiple ballet companies. While individual ballet companies maintain their own websites with performance information, there's no centralized resource that aggregates this data in a user-friendly format.

The vision for World Ballets is to become the definitive online destination for ballet performance discovery, making the art form more accessible and helping audiences connect with performances they might otherwise miss.

## Problems Solved

1. **Information Fragmentation**
   - Users currently need to visit multiple websites to discover performances
   - Different companies present information in inconsistent formats
   - No easy way to compare performances across companies

2. **Discovery Challenges**
   - Difficult to find performances by date across multiple companies
   - No centralized timeline of upcoming ballet events
   - Limited visibility for smaller companies or special performances

3. **Planning Difficulties**
   - Ballet enthusiasts struggle to plan attendance when traveling
   - No easy way to see what performances are happening in different cities
   - Difficulty tracking when favorite ballets are being performed

## User Experience Goals

1. **Elegant Simplicity**
   - Clean, uncluttered design that reflects the elegance of ballet
   - Intuitive navigation that doesn't require explanation
   - Visual emphasis on performance imagery and essential information

2. **Effortless Discovery**
   - Multiple pathways to discover performances (by company, date, or ballet)
   - Clear timeline visualization of upcoming performances
   - Featured performances to highlight significant events

3. **Comprehensive Information**
   - Detailed performance information including dates, descriptions, and media
   - Company profiles with relevant background and context
   - Links to official sources for deeper information or ticket purchasing
