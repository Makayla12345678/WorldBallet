# World Ballets Project Progress

## Current Status: Development Phase

The World Ballets project is currently in the **development phase**, with the frontend structure in place and the backend server implemented but not yet fully integrated. The project is approximately **60% complete** based on the initial requirements.

## What Works

### Frontend
- ✅ Main page HTML structure and styling
- ✅ Company pages for ABT and NBC
- ✅ JavaScript modules for data handling (DataService)
- ✅ UI controllers for rendering performance data
- ✅ Mock data implementation for development
- ✅ Responsive design basics

### Backend
- ✅ Node.js server with Express
- ✅ MongoDB models defined
- ✅ API routes implemented
- ✅ Scrapers for NBC and ABT
- ✅ Scheduled scraping functionality
- ✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## What's In Progress

### Frontend-Backend Integration
- 🔄 Updating data-service.js to use the API
- 🔄 Testing the integration between frontend and backend
- 🔄 Implementing error handling for API failures

### Server Deployment
- 🔄 Setting up MongoDB Atlas
- 🔄 Configuring environment variables
- 🔄 Testing server in development mode

## What's Left to Build

### Additional Ballet Companies
- ❌ Paris Opera Ballet (POB) scraper and page
- ❌ Bolshoi Ballet scraper and page
- ❌ Royal Ballet scraper and page
- ❌ Stuttgart Ballet scraper and page
- ❌ Boston Ballet scraper and page

### Enhanced Features
- ❌ Advanced filtering for performances
- ❌ Search functionality
- ❌ Performance detail pages
- ❌ Improved image handling and galleries
- ❌ Loading states and animations

### Deployment and Production
- ❌ Production server deployment
- ❌ Frontend hosting setup
- ❌ Monitoring and logging implementation
- ❌ Performance optimization

## Known Issues

### Frontend Issues
1. **Navigation Responsiveness**: The navigation bar doesn't collapse well on smaller screens, causing layout issues.
2. **Image Placeholders**: Currently using placeholder images instead of actual ballet company logos and performance images.
3. **Timeline Rendering**: The performance timeline can become cluttered when there are many performances.

### Backend Issues
1. **MongoDB Connection**: The MongoDB connection string in .env is a placeholder and needs to be updated with actual credentials.
2. **Scraper Robustness**: Current scrapers may break if ballet company websites change their structure.
3. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases in API error handling need improvement.

## Decision Evolution

### Data Source Strategy
- **Initial Plan**: Use client-side scraping for all ballet companies
- **Current Approach**: Server-side scraping with API for frontend access
- **Rationale**: CORS limitations and reliability concerns with client-side scraping

### Database Choice
- **Initial Plan**: Use local JSON files for data storage
- **Current Approach**: MongoDB for flexible schema and scalability
- **Rationale**: Better support for the varying data structures across ballet companies

### UI Architecture
- **Initial Plan**: Single-page application with dynamic content loading
- **Current Approach**: Multi-page site with shared components
- **Rationale**: Simpler implementation and better SEO potential

## Next Priorities

1. **Complete MongoDB Setup**
   - Create MongoDB Atlas account
   - Update connection string in .env
   - Test database connection and operations

2. **Finalize Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Update data-service.js to use the API
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Test with real and mock data

3. **Deploy Server for Development**
   - Install dependencies
   - Start server in development mode
   - Verify API endpoints are working

4. **Add Support for Additional Companies**
   - Implement scrapers for remaining ballet companies
   - Create company pages for each
   - Test data flow from scraper to frontend

## Blockers and Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- MongoDB Atlas account setup required
- Server deployment environment needed

### Dependencies
- Ballet company websites must maintain relatively stable HTML structure
- Node.js and npm for server development
- MongoDB for data storage

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- User accounts for saving favorite performances
- Email notifications for upcoming performances
- Mobile app version
- Integration with ticket purchasing systems
- Social sharing features

### Technical Debt to Address
- Improve scraper maintainability with better abstraction
- Enhance test coverage for both frontend and backend
- Refactor CSS for better organization and reuse
- Optimize image loading and processing
